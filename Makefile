# - Breaks when files have spaces in them
# - Doesn't ignore files in the dockerignore if they are added or deleted

# What this madness does:
#
# .image_marker: A listing of files that were used for the previous build (this hangs around but should not be checked in)
# .thisFileWillNeverExistEver: A temporary listing of current files
#
# The two files will be compared. If there are any differences in the files (IE a file was deleted or added), the script
# will touch the Makefile (this is important in the next step)
# .thisFileWillNeverExistEver is then deleted (it's no longer needed)
#
# In the second step of the script, all files that aren't in dockerignore are found, and used as the pre-reqs for .image_marker
# If any files are newer than .image_marker the recipe will be invoked.
# If the makefile was touched in the first step, the recipe will be invoked.
